% This Latex file will act as template to help you make assignments or submit homework.

% Every .tex file usually consists of four parts.
% 1. Document Class
% 2. Packages
% 3. Header
% 4. Your Document

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% 1. Document Class
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
 
% The first command you will always have will declare your document class. This tells LaTeX what type of document you are creating (article, presentation, poster, etc). 
% \documentclass is the command
% in {} you specify the type of document
% in [] you define additional parameters
 
\documentclass[a4paper,11pt]{article} % This defines the style of your paper

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% 2. Packages
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% Packages are libraries of commands that LaTeX can call when compiling the document. With the specialized commands you can customize the formatting of your document.

% First, we usually want to set the margins of our document. For this we use the package geometry. We call the package with the \usepackage command. The package goes in the {}, the parameters again go into the [].
\usepackage[top = 2.5cm, bottom = 2.5cm, left = 2cm, right = 2cm]{geometry} 

% Unfortunately, LaTeX has a hard time interpreting German Umlaute. The following two lines and packages should help. If it doesn't work for you please let me know.
% \usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
% \usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}

% The following two packages - multirow and booktabs - are needed to create nice looking tables.
\usepackage{multirow} % Multirow is for tables with multiple rows within one cell.
\usepackage{booktabs} % For even nicer tables.

% As we usually want to include some plots (.pdf files) we need a package for that.
% \usepackage{graphicx} 

% The default setting of LaTeX is to indent new paragraphs. This is useful for articles. But not really nice for homework problem sets. The following command sets the indent to 0.
\usepackage{setspace}
\setlength{\parindent}{0in}
\usepackage{hyperref}

% Package to place figures where you want them.
\usepackage{float}

% The fancyhdr package let's us create nice headers.
\usepackage{fancyhdr}

% For simple, non "graphical" tree you can use the dirtree package:
\usepackage{dirtree}

% For highlighting phrases using graphical boxes.
\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}

% for math functions
\usepackage{amsmath}

%for coloring the text
\usepackage[dvipsnames]{xcolor}
\usepackage{enumitem}
\usepackage{listings}
\usepackage{color}
\usepackage{tikz}
\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc} 
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
\lstdefinestyle{customasm}{
    belowcaptionskip=1\baselineskip,
    frame=single, 
    frameround=tttt,
    xleftmargin=\parindent,
    language=[x86masm]Assembler,
    basicstyle=\footnotesize\ttfamily,
    commentstyle=\itshape\color{green!60!black},
    keywordstyle=\color{blue!80!black},
    identifierstyle=\color{red!80!black},
    tabsize=4,
    numbers=left,
    numbersep=8pt,
    stepnumber=1,
    numberstyle=\tiny\color{gray}, 
    columns = fullflexible,
}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% 3. Header (and Footer)
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% To make our document nice we want a header and number the pages in the footer.

\pagestyle{fancy} % With this command we can customize the header style.

\fancyhf{} % This makes sure we do not have other information in our header or footer.

\lhead{\footnotesize CSO: Lab Exam}% \lhead puts text in the top left corner. \footnotesize sets our font to a smaller size.

%\rhead works just like \lhead (you can also use \chead)
% \rhead{\footnotesize Lastname 1, Lastname 2 (\& Lastname 3)} %<---- Fill in your lastnames.

% Similar commands work for the footer (\lfoot, \cfoot and \rfoot).
% We want to put our page number in the center.
\cfoot{\footnotesize \thepage} 


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% 4. Your document
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{document}

%----------------------------------------------%
% Title section of the document
%----------------------------------------------%

% For the title section we want to reproduce the title section of the Problem Set and add your names.

\thispagestyle{empty} % This command disables the header on the first page. 

\begin{tabular}{p{15.5cm}} % This is a simple tabular environment to align your text nicely

\end{tabular} % Our tabular environment ends here.

% \vspace*{0.3cm} % Now we want to add some vertical space in between the line and our title.

% Assignment Introduction %
%----------------------------------------------%

% Welcome to Assignment 1 of the Computer Systems Organisation Course. The aim of this assignment is to familiarize you with writing x86 code. 
% On completion of this assignment you should be able to successfully write arithmetic, conditional, looping components, procedure calls, and conditional jumps in x86-64. 

\paragraph{\textbf{Note:}} Read the given information below carefully.

\begin{itemize}
    \item There are 12 problems in this question bank.
    \item You need to solve only those questions which are assigned to you during the exam.
    \item Assume  signed/unsigned long long int or double based on the question.
          %\item Overflow cases to be handled 
    \item Make suitable assumptions wherever necessary.
    \item Tentative marks problem 1 to 6: 15 marks for each question; from problem 7 to 12: 25 marks for each.
    \item Comments: Not necessary. But some comments to guide us in evaluations would help. Note: Only some basic comments are enough. Donâ€™t add comments for each line. It would take too much of your time and would actually make it difficult for us to find the main parts of your code. So if adding comments, just add a few comments near the main parts of your code.
    \item Naive solution is fine.However, the solution should be reasonable enough. It shouldn't be too complicated too.For example, if you are asked to sort, we don't expect you to use merge sort. You can use a naive algorithm like bubble sort which solves the problem in O($n^2$). But if you come up with something overly complicated like a O($n^{3}$) or O($n^4$) solution and as a result of which your code fails to run even on small/simple test cases, then that can attract penalties.
    \item For some questions we have included function format for convenience but it is not necessary to follow them.
    \item You must strictly stick to the input and output formats.
    \item  Your C file can contain only inputs, outputs and memory allocations. Everything else should be in a function defined in assembly which will be invoked from C file.
    \item No need to handle overflow or invalid input cases unless explicitly asked to handle them in the question.
    \item For the questions requiring sorting, be thorough with the code of Bubble sort, Selection sort and insertion sort. You can be asked to code any of the three without giving choice.


          % \item Make suitable assumptions wherever needed. 

\end{itemize}

% \paragraph{Submission format:}Strictly adhere to the following submission format. Failure to do so may result in an erroneous evaluation of your assignment.

% \begin{itemize}
%     \item The following directory structure is expected, \\
% \hfill\begin{minipage}{\dimexpr\textwidth-3cm}
